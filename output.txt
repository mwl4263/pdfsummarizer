XML  stands for Extensible Markup Language. It started out more than ten years ago and was originally used b y very few. Lately there has been a backlash in certain quarters over its perceived failings and weak points. Nevertheless, XML now has a permanent place in IT systems. It’s hard to imagine an y non-trivial application that doesn’t use XML.There are two main uses for XML. One is a wa y to represent low-level. data, for example configur ation files. The second is awa y to add metada -insuredta to documents. The document text iscontained in an over all container, the <body> element.Binary files are just a stream of bits (1s and 0s) and can only be read and produced by computer progr ams. The main advantage of binary formats is that they are concise and can be expressed in a relatively small space. Mixing data and metadata is both common and str aightforward in a binary file.Text files are similar to binary files in that they are machine readable. They are also compar atively easier toparse than binary files. The main disadvantage of text files is their size. They also lack support for metadata. This brings us to the subject of markup. The way that characters are represen ted by the underlying data stream is referred to as a file’s encoding.Standard Gener alizedMarkup Language (SGML) was released in the mid-1990s. SGML is a subset of Extensible Markup Language, or XML. XML allows you to create your own markuplanguage and then define it using a standard syntax.World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organizationfor the World Wide Web. The standardsdocumen ts go through various stages such as Working Draft and Candidate Recomme ndation before becoming a Recom me ndated. This process can take many years. Most of the technologies discussed in this book have a W3C  recommen dation associated with them.The two common features of virtually all XML file are called elements and attributes. Using the XML format is much easier to map these data items within the ap -                plication itself so they can be handled correctly. The metadata adds about 130 extr a char acters to the original 43 char acter size, an increase of more than 300 percent.Browsers use an XML stylesheet or transforma tion to display XML files. The browser has shown the metadata in a differentcolor than the base data. This allows expansion and contraction of the applicationUsers section. Even though the browser has no idea that this file represents three different users, it knows that some of the content is to be handled differently.Using a browser to view XML files has a number of advantages. Most browsers allow for poorly formed HTML so you won’t be able to see if what you’ve produced has errors. The rules of XML have to bequite strict, but this also works to the user ’s advantage.It’s easier to tell whether a file is legitimate, or valid, when the data is in quotationmarks. This means unsuitable files can be rejected at an early stage. The need for quotes in turn mak es it easy to tell when certain data is missing.XML-formatted data flourishes over simple text files when representing a hier arch y. This is because there are no delimiters specifying where the individual data items begin and end. With the XML version it’ s easy to separ ate the dif -                ferent components of a user ’s name.The main advantage of XML is interoper ability. It is much quick er toagree on or publish an XML format and use that to exchange data. This is better than having an arbitr ary format that requires accompan r aryformation for processing. Before Microsoft W ord 2003, W ord used a binaryformat for its documents.XML was first used in the mid-’90s and is still widely used. There have been changes in how and where it is used and associated technologies. There has also been a massive improvement in the tools available to manage XML in its various guises. There is a more over all consensus of when not to use XML, although plenty of die-hards still offer it as the solution to every conceivableproblem.XML is designed to be read and understood b y both humans and software. It is also frequently used as a means of representing and storing data. The main reasons for this use are XML ’s flexible nature and the relative ease with which these files can read and edited b y humans and machines.Nearly all modern configur ation files use XML. XML is used both as a convenient wa y to serialize objects in a cross-platform manner and as a means of returning results in a univer -sally accepted fashion. SO AP-style services are also described using an XML format called WSDL.Most modern high-end database systems, such as Or acle and SQL Server, can store XML documents. XML can be used to store information such as a document’ s author, the date of cre -                ation, and an y modifications. XML shouldenable updates using the X Query language, which is briefly covered later in this chapter.XML is a rich and flexible programming language. It can be used to create documents for a wide range of purposes. The book explains how to use a variety of XML parsers to work with an XML document. It also explains some of the associated technologies, standards, and patterns.MSXML (Microsoft Core XML Services) is Microsoft’s standard set of XML tools. It is exposed as a number of COMobjects so it can be accessed using older forms of Visual Basic (6 and below) as well as from C++ and script. It has all the standard Document Object Model features plus a few extr a ones.The Document Object Model (DOM) is a tree-lik e repre -sentation of an XML document. It is used by man y Java-based XML applications and is a more popular choice than Java. The DOM was used for man y years, but it has a reputation for being unwieldy and difficult to use.XML Schemas offer more functionality because they are written in XML. D TDs use acompletely different format that is much harder to work with. Most modern XML editors allow you to create an XML document based on a specified Schema. There are other ways of ensuring the documents you receive are in the correct format.XPath is used in man y XML technologies. It enables you to target specificelements or attributes. XPath is dealt with in more detail in Chapter 7, “Extr acting Data From XML’’. See Chapter 3 for the full story onnamespaces.Browsers have been specially de -signed to be able to accept an XML as an input and tr ansform the data. This is especially the case when the data consists of man y rows of similar data that are to be shown in tabular form. HTML tables are very verbose and can easily double or triple the amount of bandwidth between client and server.Use the appUsers.xml file created earlier to produce a demonstration of how a basic transforma tion can be achieved within a browser. To start, create the following file using any text editor and save it as appUsersWithXslt. Next make a small change to the file so that, if it is opened in a browser, the browser will know to use the specified XSLT.The XML file appUsers.xslt has two xsl:templates. The first causes the basic structure of an HTML file to appear along with the outline of a table. The second template acts on any user element that appears in the file and produces one row of data for each that is found.XQuery can be used to process the appUsers.xml file from the previous examples and produce an HTML page showing the users in a tabular form. XQuery shares man y features with X SLT and because of this, a commonquestion on the XML development forums is, “Is this a job for XSLT or                XQuery?”XQuery uses br aces ({}) to mark parts of the document that need processing. X SLT uses the doc() function to read an external file, and then creates one <tr>  element for each user element found there. X Query is covered in depth in Chapter 9.The W3C recommendation for these standards is called XProc. Only a handful of implementations exist at the moment, but if you have the need for this type of workflow it’ s certainly worth taking a look at it. The next chapter discusses the rules for constructing XML and what constituent parts can mak e up a document.There are two main types of XML formats: Those used to store pure data, and those used to addmetadata to documents. XML specifications are curated b y the W orld Wide W eb Consortium, the W3C. XML is used to represent the data that is passed to, andreturned from, a web service. XML stands for Extensible Markup Language . It started out more than ten years ago and was originally used b y very few . XML now has a permanent place in IT systems . It’s hard to imagine an 'non-trivial application' that doesn’t use XML for some degree .
 There are two main uses for XML: One is a wa y to represent low-level data, for example configur ation files . The second is to add metada -glyta to documents; for example, you want to stress a particular sen -glytence in a report b y putting it in italics or bold . The document text is contained in an over all container, the <body> element .
 A binary file, at its simplest, is just a stream of bits (1s and 0s) It’s up to the application that created the binary file to understand what all of the bits mean . Binary files can only be read and produced by computer progr ams, which have been written to under -ishlystand them .
 Text files are easier to read and manipulate than binary files . The main disadvantage of text files is their lack of support for metadata . XML has a way of specifying how a file was encoded, and you’ll see these later on . Text files can also be read by a wide range of applications, such as Notepad or W ordPad .
 Standard Generized Generized Markup Language (SGML) was released in the mid-1990s . SGML allows you to create your own markup language and then define it using a standard syntax . The most ubiquitous example of this is HTML, which uses angular br ackets to separate text from basic text .
 The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the main international standards organization for the Web . It has a number of working groups targeting different aspects of the Web that discuss standardization and documen tation of the different technologies used on the Internet . XML doesn’t dictate the over all format of a file or what can be added, it just specifies a few rules .
 Using the XML format r ather than the plain text version, it’s much easier to map these data items within the ap -                plication itself so they can be handled correctly . The two common features of virtually all XML files are called elements  and attributes . A big disadvantage of this metadata is the consequent increase in the size of the file .
 The browser has shown the metadata in a different color than the base data, and allows expansion and contraction of the applicationUsers section . Even though the browser has no idea that this file represents three different users, it knows that some of the content is to be handled differently from other parts .
 In this case the original XML is transforme d into HTML, which allows for the styling of elements to give the different colors as well as the ability to expand and contract sections using script . The rules of XML have to be quite strict, but this also works to the user ’s advantage . XML is simple with XML as there are no built-in presentational fea -heticaltures such as exist in HTML .
 The need for quotes in turn mak es it easy to tell when certain data is missing . Unsuitable files can be rejected at an early stage causing application errors . The easy extensibility of XML files is also an advantage in XML files . The older version of the application can still consume this data and ignore the middle name information .
 XML-formatted data flourishes over simple text files when representing a hier arch y . XML is hard to read and quickly assimilate with text files . For example, a text file has a column representing the path and one to describe whether it’s a folder or a file: Path Type .
 The main advantage of XML is the ability to use an XML format to exchange data between applications . XML is much easier to use than binary files that require an arbitr ary format that requires accompan ying in-formation for processing . XML can be used to create documents in a format that is easy to read and create .
 The W3C XML Recommen dation is available at www.w3C.org/TR/XML . This chapter deals with some of the current uses of XML and gives a foretaste of what is coming in the chapters ahead . XML is truly the best-choice-choice for web services and Ajax .
 Data-centric uses of XML are known as data-centric and document-centric . Document-centric use of SGML and XHTML is a document-ori -centric application of the tool . XML is designed to be read and understood b y both humans and software . It is also frequently used as a means of representing and storing data .
 XML is used both as a convenient way to serialize objects in a cross-platform manner and as a means of returning results in a univer -sally accepted fashion .

 XML is rich and flexible, but for all but the most trivial processing, code using basic string manipulation will be unreliable . A number of XML parsers are available — some free, some as well as free — that facilitate the break down and yield more reli -centricable results .
 MSXML (Microsoft Core XML Services) is Microsoft’ s standard set of XML tools . It is exposed as a number of COM-objects so it can be accessed using older forms of Visual Basic (6 and below) as well as from C++ and script . In these browsers the MS XML parsers are invok ed using the ActiveX technology, which can present problems in some secure envi -renalments .
 Document Object Model exposes properties and methods that let you extr act information from and modify the XML . The DOM was used for man y years, but it has a reputation for being unwieldy and difficult to use . It also tends to tak e up a lot of memo - or memo -ry . As a result of these problems, a number of other models have sprung up .
 Most recently developed XML formats are described using schemas r ather than D TDs . D TDs use acompletely different format that is much harder to work with than XML Schemas . DTDs and XML Schemas are covered in depth in Chapters 4 and 5 .
 XPath enables you to target specific elements or attributes . XPath is used in XSLT, X Query and other XML-related technologies . It works similar to how paths in a filesystem work, starting at the root and progressing through the various la yers until the target is found .

 The browser sees the following line at the top of the XML: ‘Use appUsers.xslt’ Instead of the default style sheet that produced the result shown in Figure 1-2, it should use appUsersWithXslt.xml . The resulting code is treated as if it were a traditional HTML page . The actual code produced by the transforma tion is shown here:
